How to update the packages on launchpad for UBUNTU
i) Update the version numbers
ii) push your changes to the UBUNTU-NOBLE branches on github
iii) request an build

i) Update the version numbers
edit ./CMakeLists.txt
Change the lines
set(kst_version_major 3)
set(kst_version_minor 0)
set(kst_version_patch 0)
You have to bump at least one of these numbers to generate a new package.

ii) push changes to the UBUNTU-NOBLE branches on github
The launchpad build system pulls a branch of kst from github that includes a ./debian directory
appropriate for the series you are compiling for.

The branches we have as of writing this are UBUNTU-JAMMY for 22.04 (which doesn't work since we upgraded to qt6), and UBUNTU-NOBLE, for 24.04 and later.
There will be more as things continue to change.

To switch to a branch:
-> git switch UBUNTU-NOBLE

If there are changes you need to make to the build system, you probably
need to edit ./debian/control.  Good luck :-)

To update your branch to kst's master branch, so you get the latest changes:
-> git merge master # pull master's changes into this branch

probably try to build it to make sure all is well.

Then push it
-> git push github UBUNTU-NOBLE

iii) make sure launchpad updates git
goto 
https://code.launchpad.net/~kst-plot/kst/+git/kstgithub
and make sure it is up to date, or request an import otherwise.

iv) request a build:
go to https://code.launchpad.net/~kst-plot/+recipes
log in
select the branch you want to build (eg kst-noble2) on the left hand side.
select request builds (green, near bottom left)

Note that generate a new package, you must increase the version.

----------

https://code.launchpad.net/~kst-plot/kst/trunk-git
https://launchpad.net/~kst-plot
* look at view_git_repositories near top right.
  ( the bzr repos are now dead )
* select the lp:kst repo
* select X recipes using this repository.

There you can edit the recipes or request builds.

The instructions for building live in the UBUNTU-NOBLE, etc
branches in github in the ./debian directory.
