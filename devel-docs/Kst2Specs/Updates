Updates are done by explicitly looping through lists of objects and items.

Kst::Objects keep track of and/or provide

  serial: the serial number (from doUpdates()) of the last time it was updated.

  serialOfLastChange: the serial number of the last time an update actually led to a change.

  minInputSerial(): the min serial of any input primitives to the object
    This method querries the inputs. 

  maxInputSerialOfLastChange(): the max serial where on of the input primitives was actually changed.
    This method also querries the inputs     

  objectUpdate(new_serial): 
    return NoChange if serial == new_serial
    return Deferred if minInputSerial < new_serial  (an input hasn't be updated yet)
    return Changed after calling internalUpdate() if maxInputSerialOfLastChange > serialOfLastChange
    return NoChange otherwise

  internalUpdate(): actually perform an update.  ** should only be called by objectUpdate **

ObjectManager::doUpdates(): The loop for updating Kst::Objects.  Calls objectUpdate().
  doUpdates() is called by:
    -datasources, by their timer or watcher
    -dialogs, at the end of apply() or equivalent
  
  Algorithm:
  loop over all datasources
    set serialOfLastChange if there was new data
    
  do 
    loop over all Objects (except data sources)
      retval = objectUpdate()
  until no retval's == Deferred


MainWindow::updateViewItems(serial): update plotitems and then views
  called by a signal emitted at the end of doUpdates()

  loop over all plot items:
    plotItem::handleChangedInputs()

  if any plotItems changed
    _tabwidget->currentView()->update()

--------------
ToDo/shortcomings
-The system does not currently honor the update rate system settings.  This needs to go into
 doUpdates(). 

-The object loop in doUpdates is inefficient, in that it may have to go through the loop
 up to D times, where D is the heirarchy depth.  The loop could instead re-sort the objects as it
 goes, so that for future visits, nothing would be deferred.  In practive, objectUpdate(new_serial)
 where new_serial == _serial is pretty cheap, and probably doesn't produce a noticible slowdown.
 In practice the heirarchy depth is 2 (curves of dataVectors) or three 
 (curves of PSD's of dataVectors)

-The updateViewItems loop only considers plot items to trigger a view update.  It does not check
 if labels have changed.  In practice, it is rare to have only labels from a data source, and no
 plots, but if one were to do this, it would not get real time redrawn.  The solution is to add
 labels to the list it checks.

-The updateViewItems loop will update the current view if any plots have changed: if only plots on
 other tabs had been changed, it would be better to not update the current view.  Not common, and
 the update is pretty fast if the plot didn't change.

-doUpdates() could be threaded
  the data source loop should not be threaded.  It's to cheap to be worth the threading overhead.
  data primitives should be looped over before all other objects
    whether data primitives updates should be threaded depends on the nature of the datasource and
    on the media it is being read from to avoid disk thrashing - dirfiles will suffer from threading
    data primitive reads, but data sources that store their data contiguously will benefit (eg, ascii).
    Using flash drives should mean all data primitives would benefit from threading.

  other data object updates can be threaded.

  suggested algorithm
    make a pool of threads
    parcel out the data objects to the threads
  
-updateViewItems() is probably the slowest operation, and could benefit from threading.
  the loop over plotItems can easily be threaded as with Objects.

  There is no way to thread the view update call with the current architecture.  It is possible
  that the refresh pixmaps stuff could be threaded, but I don't know how yet.
