Zoom Mode Plot Bugs:
  -Zooming gets slower the more points there are in the curves. It should
  always be fast.


Zoom lines not updated on <ctrl> or <shift>
what happens:
  Put the mouse in a plot and depress <ctrl>.  Nothing Happens.
  Now move the mouse.  A vertical line appears where the mouse is.
  Move the mouse around.  The line follows the mouse.
  Now release <ctrl>.  The line stays until the mouse is moved again.
What should happen:
  The line should appear when <ctrl> is pressed, and disappear when
  <ctrl> is released, independent of mouse moves.
  
Tied X-Only (<ctrl>) zooms adjust X and Y.
What happens:
  create two plots (eg, 1 of gyrodata.dat col 1 and one from gyrodata.dat 
  col 2).  Make sure they have different Y ranges.  Tie their zooms.  Now
  adjust the X-range only from one plot with <ctrl>+mouse.  Both plots end up
  with the same X and Y range.
What should happen:
  Only the X range should change.


Rotated labels in boxes drift on resize...
Create a box in kst.  Put a label in the box.  Rotate the label.
Repeatedly resize the box.
What Happens:
  The location of the label in the box drifts (so when the box is set back to
  its original position, the label is not in its original position).
What Should happen:
  location of the label should stay fixed relative to the size of the box,
  so that when the box is returned to its original size, the label returns
  to its original position.
Note: if the text label is not rotated, it doesn't seem to drift.

Label Parsing
place a special characters in a plot label (eg, \omega in the X axis label).
The special character is not interpreted.  It should be.
Note: it is interpreted properly in floating labels.


Plot ranges don't update.
Create a plot with a curve of sine vs INDEX from dm.cur.  Read from end the last 100 frames.  In the plot hit 'm'.
What happens:
  As the curve is updated it dissappears from the plot.  Hitting 'm' recenters the curve.
What should happen:
  In 'm' zoom mode, the plot ranges should dynamically update to cover the full range of the curve on every curve update (As if you were holding 'm' down continuously.  Try kst1.x for a demonstration of the appropriate behavior.

Crash deleting last tab:
start kst, and in the only tab, select rmb->close.  CRASH!
This is especially a problem since this is what TabWidget->clear() does.  TabWidget->clear() is used when opening
a file to get rid of all of the old tabs.   As a temp hack (to allow file opening) clear() is not called on file open,
so all of the old tabs linger after opening a file.  This should be reverted once the bug is fixed.

-----------
Editing a slave vector from a vector selector should bring up the
edit dialog for the provider.  Instead it brings up a vector edit 
dialog.... not what is wanted and won't work anyway.
(cbn to fix this)

-----------
Editing a slave scalar from a scalar selector should bring up the
edit dialog for the provider.  Instead it brings up a scalar edit 
dialog.... not what is wanted and won't work anyway.
(cbn to fix this)

----------
Cur files no longer work.
Select a cur file from dirfile_maker.  It thinks its a ascii file.

--------
Problems reading files from the command line
  ascii files can't find any fields from the command line

--------
Only dirfiles can be chosen from the data wizard.
  ascii files can't find any fields

--------
Update curve after editing equation
Create a plot with a curve from an equation.
    eg, x = 0..100, y = x
Put the plot in auto zoom ('m') mode.
Edit the equation to change its Y range
    eg, x = 0..100, y = 2x
On apply, nothing changes.
Do something that causes the curve to redraw (eg, resize the window).
The curve redraws, but the Y zoom range stays at the old range.  'm' resets to the old zoom range.
Now edit the curve, do nothing, and hit OK.  Still no change.
Now do something to redraw the plot.  'm' mode now works.

-------
Butterworth low-pass crashes.
  create a plot, apply filter with order=4, lowpass = 0.01.  Crash.
  
-------
When chosing to filter a curve from the plot rmb, the input vectors should be fixed to the right thing:
  eg, Butterworth low pass Y vector should be fixed to the Y vector of the curve selected in the RMB menu.

-------
Entering a numerical value into a scalar selector should create a scalar of that value, if there is not
already a scalar of that name.  This is particularly important for plugin entries.  It can be created when
the scalar that the selector has selected is asked for.

--------
Ascii file configure button troubles I: it doesn't work.
  Configure from the data wizard brings up the configuration dialog, but applying it does nothing.

--------
Ascii file configure button troubles I: it crashes
  Configure from the vector dialog crashes kst

--------
Filters should have default values
  eg, low pass filter should default to order = 4, lowpass  = 0.1: see 1.x for defaults.

-------
Problems with file selector
If you browse to select a dirfile, the name of the previous dirfile has been put into "File name:" entry.  So you have to erase it to select a dirfile.
Of course, selecting a data file replaces the old name with a new one, but there is no way to clear it selecting a dirfile.
If the 'current file' is a dirfile, then the File name entry should be blank.
Either:
  always clear the current file: entry when a directory is changed, and don't fill it in the first place if the default file is a directory
Or:
  Check to see if the current directory is recognized as a valid datasource - if it is, clear the current file entry.

--------
Change data sample range tool doesn't use defaults.
---------

Accelerators for the plot edit dialog:
'E' should bring up the plot edit dialog

---------

Places where text labels are entered need string and scalar selectors to aid in the insertion of 
strings and scalars (eg, primarily label editor)

---------

Missing tabs in plot dialog:
  -There is no tab to set size, position, and rotation.  There should be.
*cbn*


Top Level View needs rmb menu:
  -set background properties (colour, gradient, etc)
  -set tied zoom mode for children (?)
  -cleanup layout menu option
*Mike*
---------

Axis labels are not transparent
Create a plot with X, or Y or Top axis labels.  Change the background of the plot to a gradient.
The axis label backgrounds are still white.  They should be the color of the background (alpha channel?)
*Mike*
---------

Axis labels should have configurable colour.
  A byproduct of making the label backgrounds transparent will be that if the background is set to a colour
  with a low contrast to black (like black, or close to black) the labels will not be visible and there is 
  currently no way to change them.
*Mike*
---------

View Object parents not preserved in saving/loading kst file
  Create a plot.  Put  a box in the plot.  Put a label in the box.
  move the plot around - verify that the box is a child of the plot.
  move the box around - verify that the label is a child of the box.
  save as a .kst file.
  load the kst file
    -note that everything is positioned relative to the tlv, and are all children of the tlv.
*Mike*
---------
Plot dialog label tab has grown out of control!  It should be shrunk to fit in 800x600
It needs to shrink.  
  -There needs to be only one scalar and string selection combos, and they need to apply
  to the most recenly selected label text entry.
  -The per-label font selection needs to be drastically shrunk.
      maybe: only the text and the size active, w/ the info in a label, with a button to edit.
      or maybe: only one font allowed for a plot, and have toggle buttons for U B I.
      or maybe: only one font and UBI combo for a plot.  UBI can be set w/ latex commands in the label.
  -get rid of all the per-item boxes and use more space efficient separators.

*Mike*
---------

Missing features in edit label label dialog:
  there is no mechanism to adjust the font, or Underline Bold Italics (UBI) in the edit label dialog.
*Mike*
---------

The entire edit label properties tab should be shown when creating a label, not just the label text and the
string/scalar selections (ie, incude size, font, UBI, and colour.)
*Mike*
---------

Labels should have configurable font and UBI.
*Mike*
---------

Tied zoom problems: (see devel-docs/Kst2Specs/Plot Geometry.pdf, last page).
  -The tied zoom conditions are not honored
  -The parent option condition is not honored.  In fact, there is no way to set parent options, even if there were parent options.
  -The plots are not automatically re-sized to have equal size once the axis are shared.

*Mike*
---------

kst settings dialogue box should select "General" when first opened
to indicate that what we're seeing to the right is the General tab.
*Mike*
--------

Double clicking on a curve in zoom mode should bring up the edit curve dialog (was in 1.x, 
but was a little buggy).
*Mike*
----------

Edit plot dialog format issue:
The tab list on the left has a minimum size set in pixels, and is not dependent on
the size of the tab names.
*Mike*
---------

"Change color per file" changes are not shown in plots until the plot is moused over.
*Mike*
--------

"Differentiate Curves" changes are not shown in plots until the plot is moused over.
*Mike*
--------

Accelerators for the plot edit dialog:
clicking on the plot outside the plot region in zoom mode should bring up the plot edit dialog.
  if on a label, to the label page
  if on the numbers to the axis range page (which doesn't yet exist).
--------


Missing tabs in plot dialog:
  -There is no tab to manually set plot zoom ranges.  There should be (see 1.x).
*cbn*
---------

When displaying data that is constant, the range is from about zero to slightly
above the curve (meaning the curve is very near the top of the plot.
instead, it should center the curve and have a range of �0.1 around the constant
value.

----------

Line Endpoints drift relative to plot contents:
Create a plot.  Put a line in the plot.  Resize the plot.
The end points of the line don't stay fixed in plot space.  
It seems to have something to do with the 'centerpoint' of the line.
It rotates around an end point.
This problem doesn't happen with boxes.
*Mike*
--------

datawizard generated multiple plots per view have the font size for
the lables way too big (so big that, in the case of 24 plots), the axis
labels take up >75% of the real estate. �The wizard should chose the font
based on the number of plots that will be in the tlv when finished.

--------

Clicking in a plot when in *layout* mode brings up the plot edit dialog.
This should only happen in *zoom* mode!  The way it is now, you can't 
move or resize plots.
--------

No way to cancel a drawing command.
  Select a drawing tool (say, a box)
  Change your mind.... tough - you have to draw something.
*Mike*
--------

No visible feedback as to what drawing mode you are in...
  Select a drawing tool (say, a box).  There is no visible indication
  that you just selected a drawing tool.  The tool should be clearly shown 
  either with the toolbar icon remaining depressed until the action is
  finished, or in the mouse icon.
*Mike*
--------
 
Export as png with a set width and height shows transparency (blank)
where extra space is, rather than resizing the view for the export.
*Mike*
----------

Should add some more latex mode fields
  \odot

--------

In labels, \textbf{text} and \textit{text} set bold and italics for 'text',
but they don't un-set bold and italics after the end of the curley brackets.
They should.

--------

Negative size drawing considered invalid.
Drawing items beginning with any corner other than the top left (negative height / width)
results in an invalid viewRect and the item drawn with a nominal size rather than the 
desired size.
This is happening during completion processing as the objects are drawn currently during
creation.
*Mike*
--------

Tied zoom behavior oddness:
Tied zoom has been implemented as a toggle button, setting or unsetting
all of the zoom ties.  However, when in tied zoom, it is still possible to un-tie
individual plots (which is good).  But: when you un-tie one of several plots, perhaps
the tied zoom button should become disabled, as you are no longer in all-tied zoom mode.
*Mike*
--------

  -Superscript and subscript size and position seems off.  This should be researched more
  but wikipedia as an almost reasonable article on it.  It suggests both should be scaled by ~60%, and subscripts dropped by 16% and superscripts raised by 44%.  OOffice, illustrator, and photoshop use scale 58%, raise 33%, lower 33%.  msoffice uses 65%, -14%, +35%.  It might also pay to compare w/ TeX.

---------

No space allocated for subscripts or superscripts in axis lables
  The subscript is cut off
---------

Number of major ticks bug:
Occasionally there will be too few (<2) or too many (serious overlap) in the number of major 
ticks.  This seems to have changed from 1.x
*Mike*
---------

Plot axis number rounding bug:
occasionally, the axis numbers can be something like 0.499999999993 instead of 0.5.  It is hard to
reproduce.
*Mike*
---------
 
Kst should ask about saving the .kst file on exit if the document has changed
(basically, any change other than a mouse/arrow zoom).  See 1.x.
*Mike*
----------
 
.kst should be appended to the name of a .kst file if it is not already there.
*Mike*
---------
 
Reference point (see 1.x, 'c')  should be implemented.
*Mike*
----------

RMB menu over a plot render item in layout mode doesn't have raise or lower, but
but does have the zoom options, etc.
the RMB menu should always have raise and lower in layout mode over any 
raisable or lowerable object.
*Mike*
--------

Shared axis Box Behavior: box shows in data mode
Create a shared axis box around some plots. A grey box appears around the shared plots.
It should not when in data mode.  In layout mode, when the group it moused over, then 
a box can appear, as with other data object.  Otherwise, no visible box.
*Mike*
--------

Automatic layout behavior: there are gaps between layed out plots
Create some plots and apply cleanup layout.  The plots are aligned in a grid,
but between the plots, and between the plots and the edge of the tlv there is a 
gap, presumably to make room for the grips.  There should be no space.  Instead
the plots should touch each other and the edge of the tlv, even if the grips would 
overlap, and even if the grips would extend partially outside the tlv.  
This applies to all layoutable objects.
*Mike*
--------

Shared axis box creation behavior:
The shared axis box dimensions are set by the corners of where the box is drawn.
This is inconvenient.  It would be better if the box dimensions were set by the
extents of all plots which have been included in the shared box.
*Mike*
--------

Shared axis box behavior: resizing separates box
Create several plots and put them in a shared axis box.
In layout mode, resize the shared axis box.  The box ends up
on top of the plots, and the plots cease to share axis.
The plots should stay in the box.
*Mike*
--------

Shared axis box creation behavior: no visual feedback
There is no visual feedback as to what plots have been selected
when drawing the shared axis box.  There should be something (eg, the
selection rect shown in mouse over mode like in layout mode)
*Mike*
--------

The size of selector on left of dialogs is too small to fit the entries, though it
is resizeable.  It should default to a size which fits all of the entries, up to
some reasonable maximum, but then be resizeable to either larger or smaller.
At one point it was fixed too small.  Then it was changed to be resizeable 
to larger than some fixed minimum.  Now it defaults too small, but can
be resized.
*Mike*
---------

Formatting/spacing issues:
  -The spacing between the X-axis numbers and the axis is too small.
  -The spacing between the Y-axis numbers and the axis doesn't seem to scale with window size.
  -The plot selection buttons are too small.

---------

Data mode (see 1.x) should be implemented
*Mike*
----------

Shared Axis box behavior: different boxes have tied zoom.
When more than one shared axis box is created, the zooms
seem to be tied between them.  The zooms should only be tied
if indicated by the tied zoom box, which the shared axis box
does not have, but should.  By default, each shared axis box
has it own zoom.
*Mike*
----------

Pointless complaints from Qt:
we are getting on the console like 
  "QGraphicsItem::ungrabMouse: not a mouse grabber".
These need to be found and killed.
*Mike*
--------

qgraphicsitem_cast is not setup correctly and causing bugs.
  A number of bugs are occurring as the result of qgraphicsitem_cast failing.  All ViewItem objects will need to be
  updated to support type and casts re-evaluated.

  This causes context menu bugs.

  Object selection bugs.
*Mike*
---------

General drawing 'flicker' and missing regions in drawing with openGL enabled:
OpenGL is qualitatively much faster, but on my laptop with Intel graphics, 
embedded, and running opengl with kwin, there is lots of flicker, and lots
of things simply not drawn.

Notes:
 - We are doing everything correctly according to the Qt documentation.

 - This can be reproduced using the Qt example code.  Corruption extends beyond
   Kst, and can be seen in all other apps showing drawing problems. while QGLWidget
   is running.

 - Sample Qt code:
    http://labs.trolltech.com/blogs/2008/06/27/accelerate-your-widgets-with-opengl/

 - Performance will be improved in future versions of Qt and is a known issue.
   http://labs.trolltech.com/blogs/2008/02/04/qt-44-and-painting-performance/

 - This bug is a platform specific to X11 and is documented by ubuntu with a work around.
   https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RedirectedDirectRendering

 - Sample app from Qt runs correctly under Windows, no reported problems with Mac.

--------

The first pane of the data wizard should be reading directories in
the background, instead of in the foreground where it steals X focus
until the directory is read. �I ran into a interminable-focus-stealing
problem where kst was attempting to read a dead NFS mount. �Required an
X restart.
*Mike*
--------

Bugs in Build System:
  -picks up libraries in lib/X11 before local libs
  -doesn't support 'make install' nor DESTDIR
---------

With multiple plots, when zooming one changes the size properties of
another (due to axis label changes, for example), the axes labels on the
non-modified plot(s) can get garbled until the mouse is moved over them.

----------

PlotMarginStandardization is applied inconsistently.
- Note: Fixed many cases.  After applying layout, plotBorders are set to Dirty, this may not be
correct.  A number of margins are not updated within the changed plot currently preventing full
validation.
*Mike*
--------

SharedAxisBox plot sharing occasionally breaks for no apparent reason.
Have not identified a pattern or cause as of yet.
*Mike*
--------

Fragility in moving parents:
  create a plot.
  Put a child box in the plot.
  Rapidly resize the plot.  Sometimes the box will either drift or loose parenting altogether.
  (Editorial: Fundamentally, I think this is because qt's QGraphics system has been used to track placement
  of objects, and QGraphics doesn't have the right model of what we are doing.)

  Note:  This is still causing parenting to fail.  Updates are required to prevent reparenting on parent resize.
*Mike*
---------

kst reads live dirfiles less efficiently than before. �On a shitty
computer (devlin666), kst1.7 can display 200 frames of 24 bolometer
channels (100Hz samples; 20 samples per frame) with a 500ms kst update
timer, and only use about 20% of the cpu and the computer will still
seem 'responsive enough'. �kst2 under the same conditions, except with
2000ms kst update timer uses about 55% of the cpu and the computer (and
kst) seem more sluggish. �
------------


Y Axis label placement is wrong
Create a plot with 24 curves from the data wizard.  The Y axis label is offset vertically.

------------

'c' mode doesn't show difference.
'c' mode is used to find the offset from a marker to the cursor.
Currently, if 'c' is hit, a marker is placed, as it should.  However, the difference between the marker and the cursor is not shown anywhere.  See 1.x for the correct behavior.

------------
Plot update problem:
  -from the data wizard create several plots.
  -Make a change to the plot that changes the size of the plot (eg, change the font size.
 The plot you changed is happy, but all of the other plots don't get automatically re-aligned.
  -Move your mouse into one of the plots that is not properly aligned.  
The curve is re-drawn to be aligned with the other curves, but the plot axis is not re-drawn.

------------

Equation update problem
  -Create a curve from a datasource.
  -create an equation from a vector from the curve.
  -Change the input vector (eg, with the 'back one screen' button)
The curve updates, but the equation/equation curve does not.

------------

Plot is not regenerated after 'ok' in the plot dialog axis tabs makes a visual change. 
 -create a plot.
 -in the plot dialog axis tab change something (eg, the 'draw grid lines' option) and hit 'ok'.
The plot is not redrawn to honor this change.  (if you do something else to force a
redraw, the change is displayed.)

-------------

Loading a kst files does not seem to work:
  -run kst
  -with the wizard, make a plot with three curves
  -save it.
  -restart kst and load the kst file you just created.
 kst gives an 'invalid Tag' error, and no plots are shown.

-------------

Accelerators everywhere.

------------

'ok' in arrow dialog moves the arrow.
draw an arrow. Open the edit dialog.  change something and hit apply.  The arrow moves.

------------

6. Unless you've explicitly given it a Unique Name, the edit curve
dialog gives no hint as to the name of the curve you're editing.  This
is a problem when you have, say, twelve curves called "2 vs. 1" in a
single plot.  In 1.x I can doubleclick on the curve to bring up the edit
dialog containing its name to figure out the name of the particular
curve "2 vs. 1" I'm interested in.  Here, I have to go by trial and
error.

------------

14. The weight of a drawn curve is apparently calculated as: (my weight)
+ (sum of weights of all lower numbered curves).  Being unable to
specify negative weights, curves just get heavier and heavier.

---------

Loading of a Kst file into a resized window does not adjust the loaded items to
fit on the new window size.

The View dimensions should be saved as part of the .kst file and if the newly created
view on a load of a .kst file doesn't match, the resize logic should be triggered.
*Mike*

---------

12. Changing the value of the fixed range limits doesn't active the
"Apply" button.

------------

Layout issues in data object dialogs:
  some dialogs, like histogram, lines up nicely, while others, like image
  is excessivly indented.  I can't see any difference in their implementation.,

------------

16. Text labels have to be entered in a tiny little text box, making
decent sized labels frustrating to edit.  Furthermore lines, in a label
are separated by "\n" now?

---------

Auto-labels, and '_' in field names:
When plots are using name-based auto-labels, any '_' in field names gets interpreted as a subscript.
  'solution'.  Append a \_ to _ in field names so the appear correctly in labels.  
  Down side: they are less nice looking in tag names.  This is acceptable (unless we end up really board).

---------

Drawing problems in resizing view items (eg, arrow)
draw an arrow.  In layout mode, grab one end and drag it around quickly.  The grab point
gradually drifts away from the mouse cursor.  It is much less pronounced if you move slowly.
*Mike*
------------

Base / Offset mode logic change:
  Base/offset should have three modes:
    On: Base/offset mode is used, regardless of if it is needed (same as current 'on')
    Auto: Base/offset mode is used if doing so makes sense (same as current 'off')
    Off: Base/offset mode is never used.

----------

Error in choice of offset mode.
Create a plot with a Y range from -0.032 to 0.041.  It goes into base/offset mode and shouldn't.

------------

Crash case: edit vector button is active in vector selectors
for error bar vectors which aren't yet set.  Clicking crashes.
---------

Default X vector field:
  We need to guess that is wanted for an X vector in dialogs which take an X vector	:

------------

10. In the content tab, double clicking on a curve in 1.x would move
it from the list it used to be in of the lists to the other.  This
saved the tedious click-on-curve, click-arrow-button,
click-on-next-curve, click-on-arrow-button 

1. data source text box in first panel of data wizard inevitably moves
the text cursor to the end of the input after entering a character,
making it difficult to edit in the middle of a path=======
---------

A spectrum curve created with the data wizard should have
the same color as a XY curve simultaneously created from the
same data field.  ie, if the XY curve of [sine] is red, the spectrum
curve of [sine] should also be red.


17. There appears to be no way to change the colour of the plot border
and tick marks from black.  I though the brush colour under "Stroke"
might do it, but nope.

Axis Label Rotation:
  Axis number labels should be rotateable, as in 1.x


Edit Multiple for Plots
  It should be possible to edit the properties of multiple plots at once.  The UI used in data objects and in 1.x works well and should be used here.
*Mike*

8. Removing a curve from an autoscaled plot and hitting "apply" removes
the curve doesn't rescale the plot.  The plot is rescaled when "Ok" is
hit in the edit plot item dialog.  Adding a curve to an autoscaled plot
and hitting "apply" does rescale the plot.

3. toggling log-x axis (key 'g') doesn't do anything until you poke at
the plot. (My impression is that a re-draw is being missed.)  toggling
log-y (key 'l') works as expected.
(cbn sees: the mouse needs to leave the plot for the plot to be redrawn)

4. toggling log-x doesn't change the x-axis tick labels/positions, even
though the curves are drawn on a log scale.  Zooming in and pressing
"M" fixes this.  Again, y-log works as expected.
(cbn says 'confirmed')

Legends don't appear to work:
  With the data wizard, create a plot, and select to create a legend.
    No legend.
  Edit a plot.  In the label tab, select having a legend.  Apply
    No legend...
----------

New tab in Data Wizard:
  There should be an option in the data wizard to create all of the new plots in a new tab.  1.x has this.

----------

XY Plots and Spectra in separate new tabs in data wizard.
  If XY plots and Spectra are both being created, there should be an option to create the Specta in a separate new tab.  1.x has this.

----------

11. When in log mode, the range reported in the range tab of the edit
plot item is the logarithm of the range.  So if the y-range is 0.1 to
100, the range will be reported as -1 to 2.  Despite this, you still
have to enter "0.1" and "100" to get this range.


Smart selection of minor tick intervals.
  There needs to be an option to automatically chose the number of minor tick intervals: 
  If the major interval is 1x10^n or 5x10^n there should be 5 minor intervals.  
  If it is 2x10^n, there should be 4.
  This was in 1.x

7. Adding a curve to a plot in the edit plot item dialog, and hitting
"Apply" causes the dialog box to grow wider.  Removing a plot does the
same thing.  The result is an ever-widening dialog box, which can't be
re-narrowed since it believes it is as small as it can get.  (It's the
list of tabs on the left which is doing the growing.)

----------
New Plot Label size mode: autoshrink.
  Add a an option to plot labels: autoshrink.  If selected, the font size used for the axis labels will reduced to the largest size (<= the current size) for which the labels don't overlap or are not truncated (only text width is considered.).  The resizing is dynamic.  If the window geometry or the label values change so that the label would fit at a larger size, the size is raised.
 - Last step after base/offset & reduced ticks.
----------

Placement widget (eg, in the curve dialog)  needs a create in new tab option.
  1.x had a 'create new tab' button.  This is similar, but does
the creation of the new tab after apply, and uses a default name rather than popping up a new dialog.

---


   3. Very often, changing the range settings of a plot does not change anything (I did not find out why it worked sometimes)


---------------------------

Shared axis not shared until a redraw.
create plots with more than 1 column (eg, 6 plots in two columns).
With a shared axis box, select two plots on the same row, so you
would expect them to share a Y axis.  
  -the bottom axis is suppresed on both.
    (they should not be)
  -The left axis on the right plot is not suppresed.
    (it should be)
until something is done to trigger a redraw (eg, a rescale) at which 
time the plots are drawn correctly.

Sharing is happening however, sharing is based upon plot projectionRect, not on
physical location.
Ie.  in scenario described the Y axis of the two plots do not match but it seems likely that the x axis range 
does match.  This results in an inappropriate sharing of the x axis when the physical location of the plots 
lends to a natural y axis sharing.  The zoom update will trigger the tied zoom code which standardizes all the 
plots.  
This proper fix for this will be part of the logic rework for shared axis as it is related directly to the above 
bug.
---------------------------

'I' key in a plot with an image should adjust the image color scale; see 1.x for correct behavior.

---------------------------

Change File Dialog is confusing.  It is not clear what the two filters at the top do, and the 
way they do it is inconsistent: The top is applyed when you hit the all from button.  The next one
is live, and the button clears the selection.  There is no way to combine the options.
  Better: a file text entry and a regexp text entry, an apply filters button, and an 'and/or' radio pair.

---------------------------

Problem with plot range and offsets:
Make a plot with the Y range from -0.75 to 0.4.  It goes into base/offset mode 
and it shouldn't.

---------

Missing X axis and cut off right edge in tied zoom box:
  create a tab with 6 plots in two columns
  make all 6 X axis the same, but with 6 different Y axis
  Create a shared axis box that encloses all 6.

There is no X axis visible.  There should be.
The right edge of the right collumn is cut off.  It shouldn't be.

------------------------------


Selecting 'share Y axis' in shared axis box context menu does not share Y axis.
  create a tab with 6 plots in two columns
  make all 6 X axis ranges the same, but with different Y axis ranges.
  Create a shared axis box that encloses all 6 plots.
  Notice that X axis is shared and Y isn't.  This is the correct default as the Y axis were different.
  Now, select 'share Y axis' in the context menu.
The check box is now marked, but the Y axis aren't shared.  

What should happen if the Y axis shared box is changed to checked:
  -The Y axis ranges should be changed to go from the minimum Y min
  shown to the maximum Y max shown of all of the plots in the box, and 
  the Y axis should be shared if properly aligned.
  -If all of the plots were in 'm' auto zoom mode, then the shared axis box will
   be in 'm' auto zoom mode, with all plots going from the minimum Y min to
   the maximum Y max.  Otherwise, the the shared box will be in fixed mode, 
   again going from the current displayed minumum Y min to the current 
   displayed maximum Y max.
  -hitting 'm' anywhere in the shared axis box will place the shared axis box 
   and all of its plots into 'm' maximum zoom mode.
  -Doing a mouse zoom in any of the shared plots will do the zoom of any shared
   axis in all of the plots, and place them all in fixed mode.

------------

unselecting 'share Y axis' in shared axis box context menu does not restore the separate Y axis.
  create a tab with 6 plots in two columns
  make all 6 X axis be the same and all 6 y axis be the same.
  Create a shared axis box that encloses all 6.
  Notice that both the X axis and Y axis are shared.  This is correct.
  Now, un-select 'share Y axis' in the context menu.

The share Y axis is no longer selected, but Y separeate Y axis are not
restored.  They should be.  Note: the Y ranges are no longer tied, even
though the axis are still shared.

------------

   7. Even if I don’t modify anything on a kst file (no click at all) kst always ask for saving the changes on closing.


----------------

Font settings in Settings->General do not appear until, eg, the window is resized.
Plots should be updated upon 'apply'.

----------------

It is not clear from the dialog that grid and color options are defaults for new plots and don't apply to existing
plots.  The text should be modified to make this clear.

---------------------

Drawing / Standardization Errors with inverted drawing of Plots

Draw a plot using the drawing tool in any direction other than down and to the right.
 - The PlotRenderItem is provided a negative size and not drawn
 - Plot standardization is triggered and all labels / axis are drawn incorrectly

---------------------

LabelCreator Dialog cleanup required.

Missing Signal - 
  Object::connect: No such signal QPlainTextEdit::textChanged(const QString &) in ../../../src/widgets/labelbuilder.cpp:23
  Object::connect:  (sender name:   '_label')

Title missing (reads Dialog)

---------------------

Make dialogs modeless.


Open the „about“ dialog box and click on a link. Nothing happens, everything disappears in the box. If kst was started from the command line, you get:
QFSFileEngine::open: No file name specified

Problems with shared axis boxes: 

Incorrect feedback in rmb menu.
Create a window with 6 plots in 2 columns.  The X axis are the same.  The Y axis are different.
Make a shared axis box with includes all 6.  As expected, the X axis are shared, and the Y aren't.
"rmb->Shared Axis Box Settings -> Share Plots on Y axis " is checked, even though the Y axis aren't shared.
Un check it.  The Y axis are now shared, even though the check box says they aren't.

Tied Zoom behavior in shared axis boxes:
Create a window with 6 plots in 2 columns.  
Create a shared axis box which shares in X but not in Y.
Select the tied zoom box in any two of the plots.  
Make a Y zoom in one of the tied plots.  The plot it is tied to does not re-zoom.  It should.

Related to above:
Create a share X axis box, which contains some, but not all of the plots.
Tie a plot inside the share axis box with a plot outside the share axis box.
Do a Y zoom on the tied plot inside the share axis box.  The one outside does not
change its zoom.  It should.

Extra tied zoom button:
There is a tied zoom box associated with shared axis boxes.  There shouldn't be.
Tied zoom boxes are only associated with plots.

I have moved the description of correct behavior which is broken by the above back to here from 'fixed bugs' :
------------------------------
Shared Axis behavioral principles:

  -All plots have a tied zoom indicator (which may not always be shown).  
  -All plots indicated as tied will have both of their axis tied, regardless if they are shared.  
  -All plots not indicated as tied will only have their axis tied if they are shared.

------------ Bugs based on the above principles: --------------

The tied zoom indicator behavior is as follows:
  For axis that are selected to be shared:
    -If any of the plots inside the shared axis box are tied to any plots outside the 
     shared axis box, then the shared axis for all plots in the shared axis box will
     be tied to the tied plots outside.
  For axis that are *not* selected to be shared:
    -The tied zoom for the *unshared* axis behaves exactly as it would if the plot 
     were not in a shared axis box.
 **Shared axis boxes do not have tied zoom indicators - only the plots do.**

Tied zoom indicator location:
  - If a plot shares *only* an X axis with a plot directly above it:
     The indicator will be to the right of the plot, with its top even with
     the top of the plot.
  - If a plot shares *only* a Y axis with the plot directly to its right:
      The indicator will be above the plot, with its top even with the right 
      of the plot.
  - If a plot shares *both* axis with a plot above and a plot to its right:
      The indicator is not shown - its behavior would be redundant with the
      indicator on the top right corner.
  - If a plot is in a shared axis box which shares both X and Y axis:
      only the plot in the top right corner  (alternativly, only plots which don't 
      share an axis with a plot above or to its right) will show its indicator.  
      The indicator would be redundant, anyway, with the indicator in the top right.

Vector selectors in opened dialogs not updated when new vectirs are created.
Start kst
From the data manager open a curve dialog and a vector dialog.
Create a vector in the vector dialog.
It does not appear in any of the vector selectors in the curve dialog.
It should.


Maximum zoom problem after breaking shared axis boxes
Create a window with several plots in 2 columns.  Each plot should have the same X range, but different Y ranges.
Create a shared axis box which includes all the plots.  Only X axis are shared, as expected.
Now, hit 'm' in one of the plots.  It's zoom is what it would be if both X and Y axis were shared
(ie, it includes all points in all plots).  But, since only the X axis are shared and the Y axis are 
not shared, the Y zoom should be such that it includes all the points in only the current plot, and not
all the plots in the shared box.  ie, the Y axis should not be effected by being in a shared box, if Y axis are
not shared.


In the « edit plot item » dialog: the size of this dialog box is not scalable. Problem is that the 
size is computed with the longest name of all the curves in the plot. And these names can be very 
long if automatically generated… 
It needs a maximum width


Intelligent and useful window title:
  If a kst file has been opened, the window title should be kst <kstfile>

plot dialog bug:  -doesn't properly fill zoom mode with 'mean centered'.

--------------------

Plot Bug:
  Mean Centered X range doesn't seem to work:
  create a plot with a curve
  Mean centered X range -> apply.  Does the right thing.
  Now advance one screen.  Plot does not advance.

--------------------

plot dialog bugs:
  -doesn't fill range with enough significant figures
*cbn*

----------------

kstdatarc is located relative to the directory from which kst is run.  It should be located in
the standard config directory.  
  For linux under KDE4, this is `kde4-config --localprefix`/share/config/
  For linux, not kde4, consider ~/.kst/
  No idea what it should be for windows or mac.  

---------------------
4. Reloading a previously saved kst files seems to forget all the “configure ascii file” settings 
(in particularly “read fields names from”) so that no vector can be generated because kst tries to 
read an unknown field! This may explain why the relative path names did not work (see bug reported 
earlier). In the meantime, it has been confirmed that reloading works with the appropriate 
kstdatarc file in the right place.

---------

"kst setting dialog" interface to global ASCII options.
kst can currently read default ascii settings from the kstrc file.
These settings need to be settable from the kstsettingsdialog.  

---------

For extreme cases of base/offset mode there are  rounding errors related to the subtraction of the base.
Rounding problems in base/offset mode:
  Log axis should never go to base offset mode - instead they should use scientific; powers should be relative to 1.
   - LogAxis are now using only two significant digits so that scientific notation is used by default.

*cbn*
---------

Crash Case: crash second time opening config dialog.
Start kst.
Open the configuration dialog (settings->configure kst), close it, then open it again.
Crash!

---------

Hitting shift changes into y-zoom mode forever, rather than just
changing it while shift is depressed.  After doing this it's difficult
to get back to xy-zoom mode.  (I have to right click twice to open and
close the context menu.)
(cbn says 'not confirmed - more info needed)
 - Tested on Windows / Linux and cannot reproduce.
--------------------

 -In the data wizard or in the data manager, select the data from a file by giving the path 
  relative to the folder where kst was started. The plot appears without problem. Save the 
  kst file in the same folder where kst was started. Close Kst from the same place and reopen 
  the kst file. It cannot plot the data. But if you go in the data manager and edit a specific 
  vector from the file, it will be plotted.

--------------------

Offset mode doesn't work in data mode.
In a plot in kst, go into data mode.  Then use 'c' to leave a marker.
It is left in the correct place.  Now move the mouse.  The offset to the marker
is not shown, but it should be.  If you leave data mode, then it is.
(behavior should be the same as 1.x).

--------------------

Showstopper printing problems:  - 2.0 needs these fixed.  otherwise, another beta :-(

Labels in Print to file are not vector quality... they should be.
This appears to be related to caching of labels...

Increasing the printer resolution to "high resolution" solves this, at the expense of huge pdf files, and very
slow print rendering.  Printed files should be all vector, not cached pixmaps.

------------------------------

USAGE() does not exit cleanly, so there are issues under windows:
 For the « kst --help » I first get the message
“Runtime Error! Program: c:\Program\klst\bin\kst.exe This application has requested the runtim to terminate it in an unusual way. Please contact the application’s support team for more information.”

Then kst closes and and I get the help in the console (cygwin) in the windows cmd.exe I don’t get any help…

---------------------


When a new plot is added to an tab which already has plots in it (eg, from the Placement widget), 
then the label font sizes should be based on the label font sizes of the plots already in the tab.  
(either 'vote' or use the first one).
All font properties replicated.  Use the first one.

--------------------

Problem resizing plots:
resizing a plot from the top or left grip points blanks out part of the plot.
Using the bottom right grip does not.

--------------------

Save as default should not default to checked in ascii configure dialog.

--------------------

The Y axis label  drifts when you resize the height of a plot with the top grip.  
Then, pull up the Plot Edit dialog, dimensions tab.  Enable 'apply' by 
selecting, then unselecting 'fix aspect ratio'.  Apply.  The plot moves, 
but the Y label is back where it should be.  Enable apply again, and hit 
apply.  The plot is back where it should be, with no problems.

--------

Reasonable/sticky defaults for the export dialog.

--------------------

Draw a line in a plot.  Resize the plot.  The line drifts away.

------------

Sensible filter in image dialog

--------------------

Rotated axis number label spacing is wrong

--------------------

ASCII settings are ignored unless they are the global defaults.

--------

Reasonable/sticky defaults for plotDefaults
See View::configurePlotFontDefaults for a place to do this...
Currently, new plots follow any existing plots, but there is no
sensibly set 1st plot default.
Probably need to set defaults in the plot dialog *Changed fields (?).
But need to figure out order - we want to also save the viewItemDialog
set fields.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fixed after beta 3
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Multi-page printing:
The code is in place and commented out, because it gets the size wrong for pages other than the current tab.
This bug is also hit in the export widget.

--------------------

Need to be able to rebuild the datasource list:
  Make a list of all dataprimitives and their file names
  Erase all data sources from the object store.
  for each dataprimitive {
    find or create (filename)
    changeFile(newDatasource) (adds to the store?)
  }

--------------------

Datasources that are browsed are created, remembered, and saved/loaded.

----------

Improve behavior of data wizard selector


------------

Names in multipage graphics file export.  name_2.png, not name.png_2, etc

--------

Printing from the command line.  This existed in 1.x
  Note: printing still requires parts of Qt which require a window session, so pure scripted 
  headless prints are not possible :-(

--------------------

When you plot 48 plots on one screen, the default text size for the
plots is way too small to be readable.  

--------------------

In zoom plot mode (hit 'z' when mouseover a plot) the text does not
increase size as the plot expands.  This doesn't look proportioned
correctly.  

--------------------

Change data samples range is clumsy to use.  I don't think that it
should default to having none of the vectors selected.  Rather, I think
it should default to all preselected (or better, all preselected if
you've never used the dialog before, but to remember which were selected
from before and default to those).  Certainly, when you make some
changes and hit apply (without closing the dialog box), the vectors you
have selected shouldn't become unselected; they should remain.  


--------------------

Plot widths with live data are variable depending on the axis numbers
position.  If, for example, you're plotting live data as a function of
INDEX and INDEX is in the hundreds of thousands, when the major tick for
INDEX is near the edge of the plot, the plot will get narrower so that
the axis number can fit in the window.  I don't think that plots should
change size at all when data is live.  
--------------------

2. When in data mode, the status bar shows the backslashes used to
escape characters in curve names.  I think that maybe (but maybe not)
the status bar should render the names (with subscripts and
superscripts, for example).  The status bar should certainly not show
escaping backslashes.  

--------------------

4. When displaying an axis as time, "offset mode" turns on (good), but
only displays offsets in seconds (bad).  When a day's worth of data is
on the screen, the unit shouldn't be seconds, or even minutes.  

--------------------

5. When displaying an axis as time and offset mode is on, the offset
steps should be natural for the type of units.  100 seconds is not
natural (120 would be, or better, 2 minutes; see the bug above).  

--------------------

1. When the x axis set to to interpret as standard C time, the time is
displayed correctly on the axis labels, but just displays as the raw
value in the status bar (on the lower left of the window).  This is both
in "normal mode" and in "data mode".

------------------

Cleanup layout totally sucks!
