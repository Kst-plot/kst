These simple test files were generated by the Debian package
maintainer: Mark Hymers <Mark.Hymers@ncl.ac.uk>.

You will need to uncompress these files to use them.  Note that if you
want to use the .kst file, the two .dat files need to be uncompressed
in the same directory.

y.dat is a 4Hz sine wave and a 4Hz cosine wave sampled at 200Hz.

yn.dat is the same as y with some uniformly distributed random
noise added.

They are hereby placed in the public domain and are simply designed
to be used when checking that kst is plotting correctly (or for learning
the basics of kst).

Importing data in 10 easy steps

1. Click on Data|Data Wizard
2. Pick y.dat or yn.dat
3. Next
4. Select columns 1 and 2
5. Select Read to end
6. Select INDEX as the X Axis Vector
7. Next
8. Select All Curves on One Plot
9. Click Finish
10. Admire your graph

Other files
===========

example.kst contains the plotted data from y.dat and yn.dat along with a FFT
for each of them.
