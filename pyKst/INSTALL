To manually install pyKst:
i) install requirements
     -the latest kst
     -python2 (not python3), because of the following requirement
     -numpy >= 1.6 (1.6.1 is known to work) 
     -scipy >= 0.9 (0.9.0 is known to work)
     -pyside or PyQT4

ii) copy pykstpp.py to your system's python script directory
  [host]$ sudo python2.7 setup.py install

iii) To test it, go into the demo directory, and try one.
  [host demo]$ python2 ./dataobjects.py

======
Example for ubuntu:

0) make sure you have the absolute latest kst from the kst-plot ppa.  See kst.kde.org

1) install dependencies for numpy and scipy
sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python python-dev python-qt4 libatlas-base-dev gcc gfortran g++

2) copy files
  [host]$ sudo python2.7 setup.py install

6) test it
[host]$ cd demo
[host]$ python2.7 dataobjects.py


========
Try with cmake:

# install the python files where they belong
sudo cmake ../cmake/pyKst

# Download, build, and install the right versions of numpy and scipy.
# This is not needed if you already have them
sudo make
